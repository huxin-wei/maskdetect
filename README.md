Mask detect

This is the first machine learning project I tried at the start of cov-19 <br />
it may not be able to represent my skills now, <br />
but it can demonstrate my learning abilities , skills of solving problems ,getting things done and overcoming difficulties <br />
I was quite an amateur at that time <br />
use pre-trained models don't konw how to optimize<br />
learn and  solve bugs from the internet <br />
mark pictures with friends all nights<br />
cool the computer with wet towels<br />
now I have a better and systemic understanding of machine learning <br />
but it is still one of the happiest and most exciting projects I did <br />
